<p align="justify"> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for building interactive and dynamic websites. Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript is an essential part of web development, enabling client-side scripting and providing functionality like form validation, animations, and real-time updates. It runs in web browsers and supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. JavaScript is known for its versatility and widespread use in both front-end and back-end development, especially with frameworks like React, Angular, and Node.js. It is a core technology of the web, often used alongside HTML and CSS to create responsive, user-friendly web applications. JavaScriptâ€™s vast ecosystem of libraries and tools continues to make it a popular and powerful choice for developers. </p>
